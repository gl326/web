We’re proud to reveal this 189-page official digital artbook for Chicory :) We had promised to (and wanted to!) make this for Kickstarter backers… but what started off as a seemingly simple project became a long journey for us. We collected art and notes from many years of development and worked with a fabulous layout artist (Hayley Ng!) to make a professional final package.</p><p>There are concept drawings, sketches, articles, interviews, never-before-seen characters and all manner of juicy process details to uncover in here. We wanted to give fans a new peek into the world, but we also wanted to share our process in a way that we think any creator can get inspired by.</p><p>We’re very proud of this and are excited to finally share it with you all!!! We hope you love it.</p><p></p>
