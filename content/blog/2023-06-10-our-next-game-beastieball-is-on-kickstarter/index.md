We’re making a turn-based volleyball RPG. YES, it’s a sport played only by creatures called Beasties. And YES, the Beasties become friends by playing together. </p><p>I am incredibly proud to finally share this project with you. It’s the most ambitious and crazy thing I’ve ever done. Please support our Kickstarter! And if you think the game is cool then tell your friends about it too! </p>
