<p>Hello!!!!!! It has been a stunning first week for our Kickstarter. We hit our ambitious goal in the first few days and are already soaring past 110% funded... thank you so much to everyone for your support!!</p><h1>New Rewards coming soon...</h1><p>We've heard from a few people disappointed that all the high-tier rewards sold out so quickly. Our surprise Kickstarter launch caught a lot of people off guard! To help mitigate that, we're pleased to announce that we'll release a new batch of high-tier rewards manually at <strong>9AM PST on June 24</strong>... 1 week from today. If you have been itching to get a high-tier reward, please set a reminder and be ready to grab 'em, because after this we <strong>don't plan to add any more</strong>!</p><p>The exact numbers are subject to change, but this is what we are planning:</p><ul><li><p>3 additional "Get in the Game!" slots (CAD $1000)</p></li><li><p>3 additional "Become a Coach!" slots (CAD $1500)</p></li><li><p>A brand new reward: <strong>Team Portrait</strong>, priced at CAD $900 with 10 slots. At this reward tier, Alexis (the Beastie director!) will draw a portrait of your in-game coach along with your team of favorite Beasties - up to 5. This could be done as soon as the campaign ends, but we expect most players will want to wait until they've played a full adventure and have a portrait to commemorate their unique final team. This reward will include all the tiers below it, including designing a custom clothing item!</p></li></ul><h1>Stretch Goals Update!</h1><figure><img src="1.png"></figure><p>We're thrilled to have hit <strong>Ironman mode</strong> today! Randomizer-Ironman is real... we can't wait to see what crazy runs ya'll get on. The next goal is <strong>Online Matchmaking</strong>, which will let you search out opponents to play online with skill-based matchmaking!</p><p>We're also pleased to reveal a new stretch goal... <strong>The Far Out</strong>. This rugged badlands/desert-themed area would be packed with new Beasties, characters and quests to discover, making your adventure that much bigger. We've been forced to shelve many of our favorite Beastie concepts because they didn't quite fit into the areas we had planned out for the base game... with this bonus area unlocked we'll have the opportunity to pack in lots of those ideas!</p><h1>Stretch Goals and Development Schedule</h1><p>We realize this new goal promises a fair amount of new content, which can be nerve-wracking for folks that have seen other large kickstarters fail to deliver on their biggest promises. We want to be clear about this: in order to make sure our dev schedule doesn't dramatically change, we are planning bonus content like this as a <strong>post-release item</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The response to this game has been honestly incredible, and at this point there's no doubt for us that we'll be pouring our hearts into this project and trying to get everything we want into this game whether the stretch goals are met or not. However, whether or not we hit the goals will likely have an impact on our plans and timing. For example, content updates might need to be released as paid DLC to help cover production costs, rather than as a free update or part of our initial release.&nbsp;</p><p>Also worth mentioning: all the prices we list are distorted from reality because in truth, we are covering a lot of cost through our own savings, and only using Kickstarter funds to supplement that.&nbsp;</p><h1>Last Notes</h1><p>We've been floored by the positive response to our demo. If you haven't already, and you have any lingering questions about how the game feels overall, we'd encourage you to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864950/Beastieball/">check it out</a>!&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you again to everyone for your huge support :) Coming up soon we'd like to share more behind-the-scenes updates that detail more about how this game is being made. Please look forward to them!</p><p>- Greg</p>
