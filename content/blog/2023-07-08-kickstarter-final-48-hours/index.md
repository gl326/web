<p>It has been a <em>whirlwind</em> of a month since we first revealed Beastieball to the world!</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/greglobanov/beastieball/">Kickstarter campaign is in its FINAL HOURS</a> now! It’s your last chance to support us at this early stage and get your hands on all our backer-exclusive merch items. We also just revealed the final stretch goal… <strong>MOD SUPPORT</strong></p><figure><img src="1.png"></figure><p>We want to refine and release our dev tools to let players create their own custom Beasties including stats, plays and custom art! Sharing would be enabled through Steam Workshop, allowing you to browse and download other people’s custom Beasties to recruit to your own team. We’re excited about all the possibilities and to see what players do with our tools!</p><p>If you’re already a supporter, thank you so much!  But if not, well… once this campaign is over, IT’S OVER. We aren’t doing slacker backer stuff or post-campaign whatevers… we’re a tiny team with no PR managers and we desperately want to get back to working on the game, lol! So when we say it’s your last chance, we really mean it! </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/greglobanov/beastieball/&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Check out the campaign HERE!&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/greglobanov/beastieball/"><span>Check out the campaign HERE!</span></a></p><p>This has been the hardest secret, the biggest game reveal, and the greatest outpouring of support we’ve ever experienced. It really has been an awesome journey for us. Stay tuned for future game news and dev updates!</p>
