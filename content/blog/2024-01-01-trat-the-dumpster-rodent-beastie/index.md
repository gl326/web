<p>Geo City! The sprawling metropolis! Explore and you’re sure to see some of the trendiest fashionistas, the biggest celebrities, and the busiest stores. And also this thing.</p><figure><img src="1.png"><figcaption>Trat: They are often found in dumpsters. When they outgrow their can, Trats will gather with many others to exchange for larger cans.</figcaption></figure><p>Trats make their homes in cans, which are plentiful in the big city. Their cans come in many varieties, as you might expect, including all the colors of the rainbow. You might even occasionally spot a Trat living in an extra-big can! It can be tough to catch a glimpse of their actual bodies, but you know they’re afoot when you see a can scurrying around. </p><figure><img src="2.png"></figure><p>When it comes to sports, Trat is as capable as any Beastie, but their style of play is very unique. They don’t have the strongest statistics, and their special traits aren’t game-changing either; you’ll commonly find one with the <strong>Mischief </strong>trait which allows them to use support plays during the defense phase. This technical-sounding ability simply means they can use strange and surprising plays to intercept the opponent’s attack or build their defenses.</p><p>And support plays are <em>indeed</em> their specialty. Trats can use all sorts of zany plays including <strong>Trait Dance</strong>, which swaps their trait with another Beasties’s, <strong>Reposition</strong>, which lets them instantly swap positions with their ally on the field, or <strong>Dispel</strong>, which makes their ally’s ball become “volleyed,” allowing their ally to counter-attack without passing the pall back and forth as usual. </p><p>Trat’s playstyle is the embodiment of why Beastieball is a team sport; sometimes you need a little creature who can cause some mayhem and disrupt the flow of things just as much as you need a powerful point-scorer. For those players who will learn all the dark corners of what’s possible in Beastieball, few opponents may strike more fear into their hearts than the mighty Trat.</p><figure><img src="3.png"></figure><p>See you in the next newsletter!</p>
