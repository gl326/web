<figure><img src="1.png"></figure><p><strong>Our next Preview Playtest is right around the corner!</strong> From August 12 to 19, we’ll be letting players explore a bit further into the world of Beastieball with a preview of Mythwood, the foresty area to the north. </p><p>If you want to play, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864950/Beastieball/">visit the game on Steam</a> and click ‘<strong>Request Access</strong>’! We’ll start sending keys out in batches starting on August 12. Note that requests will be granted by random selection and not everybody will get in!</p><ul><li><p>(If you’re a Content Creator, you can request a playtest key via <a href="https://www.keymailer.co/g/games/94e5e9d0">Keymailer here.</a>)</p></li></ul><p>Save files from the free demo or the previous Playtest <strong>will carry over</strong> into this Playtest. In fact, if you had access to the previous Playtest then you will be automatically included in this one as well. And your save data will carry over from Playtests to the final release, too - we know how important your team is and we want you to be able to finish your journey with them no matter what!</p><h2>PAX West!</h2><p>While we’re here, we just want to let you know that we’ll be showing Beastieball at PAX West in Seattle from August 30 to September 2. We’ll also have cool exclusive merch available! If you happen to be in town we hope you’ll stop by and say hello :)</p><p>That’s all for now.
