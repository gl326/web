<figure><img src="1.png"></figure><p>We owe our players an apology. We released Beastieball with a critical issue. In the version we launched with, Beasties played sports and humans coached them. But everyone knows animals can’t play sports… <em>humans do!</em> We’re very sorry for leaving this issue unaddressed for so long. Thankfully, it’s finally fixed.</p><p>We’d strongly encourage you to take the time to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864950/Beastieball/">check out the game</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2404130/Beastieball_Demo/">the free demo</a> today and enjoy Beastieball as it always should have been.</p><p>Happy April Fool’s Day!</p><p></p>
